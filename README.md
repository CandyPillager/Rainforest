## What

A fork of Paper for my personal patches.

This project is only for both patches I'm working on and will/have PR('d) to
Paper, as well as patches which simply will not touch Paper for one or another
reason.

## Support

If you ask for support by Paper in their Discord or issue tracker, you will be
fed to goblins, and your limbs will be forcefully removed. Open an issue on this
repository's issue tracker instead, or contact me in the Discord.

## Building

Run the following commands in the root directory:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
./rainforest jar
```
